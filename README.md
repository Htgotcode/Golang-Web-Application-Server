# Golang-Web-Application-Server

The aim was to create a full stack application that provides users with a platform to trade/resell valuable collectable cards. 
The cards have multiple attributes such as price, rarity, brand and a description. 
Buyers will be able to access the application where they can purchase multiple cards at once.

Additionally as the application development progressed, there were additional requests from the clients. The application successfully adapted to these changes most notably the application was integrated into Google Analytics.
